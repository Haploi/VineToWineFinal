                <p class="mbr-text mbr-black mbr-regular mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p><a href="http://www.lewine.be"></a>Mr. Marc Schiettekat is a Director and founding Shareholder of the General Partner, Triple A Management Group S.à.r.l..
<br><br>He has over 36 years’ experience in the wine and vineyard business and his group of international companies (Le Wine, Winco, Master Winemakers) sell over 54 million bottles of wine annually all over the world. His full experience and expertise of the vine and wine business, together with his international contacts and manpower will be at the disposal of the fund and its international subsidiaries whenever needed. These vast resources are available to the management of the fund within the fixed costs of the fund and its subsidiaries as explained in the Fund´s Offering Memorandum.
<br><br>His companies work in close collaboration with over 50 producers and winemakers from around the world. Among them some of the largest and/or most respected names in the business. They supply over 200 importers and distributors and have the finest relations with a lot of leading supermarket chains.
<br><br>The interest of Mr. Schiettekat and his companies in the Vine to Wine Fund is full vineyard management and quality control of premium estate wines. The advantage to the Fund and its investors is to have a range of specialists managing the complete wine interests of the Fund with a clear perception of the ongoing movements in the wine business. Additionally, their enormous commercial impact is offering the Fund direct access to the best markets and customers worldwide.
<br><br>Mr. Schiettekat and his team of 35 expert professionals of the vineyard and wine sectors believe that wine despite its sometimes iconic heights is still an underestimated product and very often treated by producers as mass agriculture. It is his belief that controlling the land, structuring vineyards and supervising the winemaking is the only way to grow fruit towards premium bottles of wine with substantial added value, and a highly desired product with millions of wine lovers around the world.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http://www.lewine.be">www.lewine.be</a></p><p><a href="http://www.masterwinemakers.wine">www.masterwinemakers.wine</a><br></p><p><a href="https://winco.be">www.winco.be&nbsp;</a><br></p><p></p>
